# LaneGuard: Advanced Lane Detection System 🚗🛣️

LaneGuard is an innovative lane detection project that employs computer vision and image processing techniques to detect and visualize lanes on roadways. The project utilizes the OpenCV library and Python programming to create an advanced system that enhances driver assistance and safety.

## Summary 📝

LaneGuard is designed to identify and track lanes on road images or video streams, offering crucial information to drivers for safer navigation. The system processes images, extracts lane markings, and overlays visual cues onto the original frames to aid drivers in maintaining proper lane positioning.

LaneGuard's sophisticated algorithms and real-time processing capabilities make it a valuable tool for autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, and road safety research.

## Features ✨

- Advanced lane detection using computer vision
- Utilizes OpenCV for image processing and analysis
- Real-time lane tracking for video streams
- Enhancement of driver assistance and safety
- Potential integration with autonomous vehicles

## Requirements 🛠️

Ensure you have the following libraries installed to run LaneGuard:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7 or higher
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) 4.5.3 or higher
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 3.4.3 or higher

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib
```

## Installation ⚙️

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vpadia717/LaneGuard.git
cd LaneGuard
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🚀

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

2. Read and preprocess road images or video frames:

```python
# Read a test image or video frame
image = cv2.imread('test_images/road.jpg')
```

3. Apply lane detection and visualization:

```python
# Process the image for lane detection
lane_detected_image = detect_lanes(image)

# Display the original and lane-detected images
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.title('Original Image')
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(lane_detected_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.title('Lane Detected Image')
plt.show()
```

4. Save or display the processed images or video frames:

```python
# Save the processed image
cv2.imwrite('output_images/lane_detected_image.jpg', lane_detected_image)

# Display the processed image
cv2.imshow('Lane Detected Image', lane_detected_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Future Enhancements 🔮

The LaneGuard project can be extended and improved in various ways:

1. Integration with vehicle control systems for lane departure warnings.
2. Real-time lane detection for live video feeds from dashcams or vehicle cameras.
3. Lane change detection and signaling assistance.
4. Semantic segmentation for more detailed lane analysis.

Contributions and suggestions for further enhancements are welcome!
